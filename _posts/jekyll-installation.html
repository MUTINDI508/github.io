<div class="post-full-content">
    <p>Jekyll is a static site generator that takes plain text files written in Markdown, runs them through Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx, or GitHub Pages. It's an excellent tool for blogs, personal websites, and documentation sites.</p>

    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ruby (version 2.7.0 or higher is recommended)</li>
        <li>RubyGems (usually comes with Ruby)</li>
        <li>GCC and Make (for compiling native extensions, common on Linux/macOS, requires DevKit on Windows)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Installation Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Install Ruby:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>macOS:</strong> Ruby is often pre-installed. You can use a version manager like `rbenv` or `RVM` for better control.</li>
                <li><strong>Linux:</strong> Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install ruby-full` on Debian/Ubuntu).</li>
                <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Use <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/" target="_blank">RubyInstaller for Windows</a>. Make sure to check the box for "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" during installation. If you're on Windows, also install the **DevKit** from RubyInstaller to compile native gems.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Install Jekyll and Bundler:</strong>
            Once Ruby is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
            <pre><code>gem install jekyll bundler</code></pre>
            This command installs Jekyll and Bundler, a gem manager that helps manage your project's Ruby dependencies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create a new Jekyll site:</strong>
            Navigate to the directory where you want to create your site and run:
            <pre><code>jekyll new my-awesome-blog</code></pre>
            Replace `my-awesome-blog` with your desired project name. This command creates a new directory with a basic Jekyll site structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Navigate into your site:</strong>
            <pre><code>cd my-awesome-blog</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve the site:</strong>
            To see your site in action, run the Jekyll server:
            <pre><code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code></pre>
            This command builds your site and starts a local server. You can usually view your site at `http://localhost:4000`. Jekyll will automatically recompile your site when you make changes to your files.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>You now have Jekyll installed and a basic site running! You can start customizing the content, themes, and layouts to build your perfect website.</p>
